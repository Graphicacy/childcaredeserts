Only 38 percent of Colorado ZIP Codes are classified as child care deserts, but they contain 46 percent of the state's residents. Child care deserts have a significantly higher proportion of people of color; while ZIP codes that have sufficient child care supply are 76 percent white, child care deserts are only 61 percent white. Three in five Hispanic Coloradans live in a child care desert, making them 50 percent more likely to live in a child care desert than white, non-Hispanic Coloradans."Georgia,13,0.148,0.1214,0.1614,0.1652,52734,127588,46457,392429,2635,49042,"About one third of Georgia ZIP Codes are child care deserts, which is the lowest rate of all eight states studied. Since Georgia child care desert are more likely to be in rural areas, the state has the lowest proportion of its residents living in child care deserts, fewer than 15 percent of Georgians live in child care deserts. Nonetheless, more than 800,000 Georgians reside in rural child care deserts, nearly half of them in areas where the poverty rate was higher than 20 percent.  The federal government funds nearly 25,000 Head Start slots, but with Georgia's high poverty rate and more than 650,000 children under five, demand greatly exceeds supply."Illinois,17,0.676,0.583,0.6557,0.8642,93273,36186,294100,138942,194180,53990,"In Illinois, more than 8 million people live in child care deserts. Whether in rural, suburban, or urban parts of the state, a majority of ZIP Codes are child care deserts. Chicago is the largest urban child care desert in all eight states, where five out of six children under the age of five live in a child care desert. Overall, 80 percent of Chicagoans live in a child care desert. Hispanic families are significantly more likely to live in an Illinois child care desert than white or Black, Non-Hispanic families, more than 86 percent of Hispanic residents of Illinois live in child care deserts."Maryland,24,0.352,0.4017,0.3073,0.5064,13976,21659,92726,170538,38865,29347,"Maryland has the second lowest rate of child care deserts in the study, though that still means one-third of Maryland ZIP Codes are child care deserts. Maryland is the most densely populated state in the study, and most Marylanders live in somewhat densely populated suburbs. Among Maryland's urban ZIP Codes, more than half of the population lives in a child care desert. As shown in Figure 12, there is a clear racial disparity in the proportion of Marylanders living in child care deserts. White, Non-Hispanic residents are much less likely to live in a child care desert than Black or Hispanic residents. Maryland also has the highest average cost of infant child care and preschool among the eight states in the study."Minnesota,27,0.721,0.7102,0.7207,0.7079,97877,15542,142108,48902,22074,23399,"This study found that Minnesota has the highest rate of child care deserts and the highest proportion of its population living in child care deserts. There were only 1,253 child care centers in Minnesota with 81,306 slots in them. With about 350,000 children under the age of five in Minnesota, that means there are more than 4 children for every child care center slot. Additionally, the Twin Cities are one of the largest urban child care deserts in the study. About two-thirds of the Minneapolis-St. Paul population, 1.2 million people, live in a child care desert. Finally, Minnesota is the most rural state in this study, and in Minnesota's rural areas child care supply is even lower: 84 percent of rural Minnesotans live in a child care desert."North Carolina,37,0.245,0.1987,0.2641,0.2557,65120,122810,86453,274050,9415,60398,"North Carolina has the most child care centers per ZIP Code of all eight states. The state was one of the first to implement a Quality Ratings and Improvement System, and all licensed child care centers are currently required to participate in the QRIS. Relative to the state median income, the average North Carolina child care center is less expensive than the other states in this study. Nonetheless, more than a quarter of North Carolinians under the age of five live in child care deserts. Like the other states in this study, the supply of child care center slots substantially lower in rural areas."Ohio,39,0.27,0.1222,0.2979,0.2412,111790,52246,54757,350583,34116,96492,"Ohio child care deserts are a disproportionately rural phenomenon. While the majority of the state population resides in suburban communities, more than a quarter of Ohioans live in rural ZIP Codes. These communities are more likely to be child care deserts than not, with nearly seven in ten rural Ohio children living in child care deserts. In total, more than 100,000 rural Ohioans under age five live in the state's child care deserts, making it the largest rural child care desert population of all eight states.

When compared to  neighboring North Carolina, a state with a larger population, Virginia has about one million more residents in child care deserts. While the majority of the Virginia's population is suburban, most ZIP Codes in the state are rural, and they include the homes of more than 2 million Virginians. Just as in many other states, these communities have the highest likelihood of being child care deserts. As a result, two-thirds of Virginia's rural children under the age of five reside in a child care desert. "
